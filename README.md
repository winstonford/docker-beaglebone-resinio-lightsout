# Light Out

A bone simple resin.io app that turns off the led lights on a beaglebone black running docker.

## What

Set triggers in the device tree, and set registers visible through the I2c bus.

## Why

If you've ever seen a beaglebone black at night, you'll know why you're reading this.  It's like lightning during a thunderstorm, only brighter. 

## How

There's nothing to do with the app.  It just works.  For me at least.

## Troubleshooting
